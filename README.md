A-while-from-done regular expression interpreter expected to have functions such as:
* storing and referencing variables
* if-statements
* lookback / lookforward
* ???
* horrible syntax due to wanting to get some value for getting used to the syntax of sed? lol

Non-functioning and (probably) full of errors for I'm writing code on a borrowed machine at the moment.
